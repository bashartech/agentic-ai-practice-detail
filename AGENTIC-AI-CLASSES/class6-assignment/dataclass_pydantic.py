# Difference between Pydantic and Dataclass

# PURPOSE:

# Both Pydantic and Dataclasses are used to define structured data models in Python.

# VALIDATION:

# Pydantic provides built-in data validation and parsing.

# Dataclasses do not perform validation by default — you must add custom logic if needed.

# TYPE ENFORCEMENT:

# Pydantic strictly enforces type hints and will automatically convert compatible types (e.g., strings to integers).

# Dataclasses rely on Python's type hints but do not enforce them at runtime.

# EASE OF ACCESS:

# Pydantic models can easily be reused across files and applications (e.g., FastAPI, Chainlit) and support .dict(), .json(), etc.

# Dataclasses can also be shared, but they don’t offer built-in serialization or schema export methods like Pydantic.

# Default Values & Optional Fields:

# Both support default values and optional fields, but Pydantic gives more control and validation rules through Field(...).

# Third-party Support:

# Pydantic is widely used in frameworks like FastAPI, which makes it a better choice for APIs and external integrations.

# Dataclasses are native to Python and useful for simpler use cases where validation is not critical.

# Performance:

# Dataclasses are lightweight and faster for pure data storage.

# Pydantic adds some overhead due to validation but provides safer and more robust data handling.
